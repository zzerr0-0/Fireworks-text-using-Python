 >> My Python Game ðŸŽ®

This is a small game built in Python using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
Originally it was a code online that I saw, the other person used CSS, I had trouble loading Git to place the code as a game, I'll possibly fix it sooner once I understand where my error falls :.

## ðŸš€ How to run it

1. Make sure you have *Python 3.10+* installed.  
   *You can check with:*
   > bash:
   python --version
